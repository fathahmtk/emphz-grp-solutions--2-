## Challenge
The park required standardized, IoT-ready retail units that could be deployed overnight to support a growing tech workforce without permanent construction.

## Solution
Deployed a fleet of 12 **UrbanCell™ RETAIL** modules integrated with the **SmartPod Grid™** IoT controller for centralized energy monitoring.

## Outcome
95% occupancy within 30 days. No disruption to park utilities during setup. Centralized billing reduced operational overhead by 40%.
