Our GRP cable trays and ladders are manufactured using pultrusion for maximum load-bearing capacity. They are essential in chemical plants where steel trays would corrode within months.

## Why It Exists
To carry heavy power cables in acid/alkali rich environments without collapsing from corrosion.

## Typical Usage
Chemical plants, offshore platforms, wastewater treatment plants, and tunnels.

## Recommended When
- Desalination plants (Chlorine)
- Fertilizer plants (Ammonia)
- Battery rooms (Acid fumes)

## Features
- Snap-fit covers
- Electrical transparency
- Zero maintenance
