EMPHZ modular tanks are assembled on-site using hot-pressed SMC panels. This allows for massive storage capacities even in areas with restricted access, like basements or rooftops.

## Why It Exists
A hygienic, algae-free alternative to concrete tanks that is easier to install than welded steel.

## Typical Usage
Residential complexes, commercial buildings, and industrial fire water storage.

## Recommended When
- High capacity storage needed (10kL - 1000kL)
- Rooftop installation (Lightweight)
- Hygienic potable water requirement

## Features
- Food-grade material
- Zero leakage design
- Fast assembly
