Engineered for the automotive sector, these GRP composite shields provide impact protection and fire retardancy for EV battery packs while keeping weight to a minimum.

## Why It Exists
Metal shields are too heavy; standard plastics melt. GRP offers the perfect balance of heat resistance and light weight.

## Typical Usage
Electric buses, 3-wheelers, and commercial EV fleets.

## Recommended When
- Weight reduction is critical
- UL 94 V0 fire rating is needed
- Impact protection for under-chassis

## Features
- High strength-to-weight
- Electrical insulation
- Thermal barrier
